/**
 * A trade asking to be told when this opens up.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated, because it is the one thing on the homepage a
 * stranger is meant to be able to do. Which means it gets the same treatment
 * as every other public route here:
 *
 *   - Throttled, because an open POST on a public URL is a form somebody will
 *     eventually point a script at.
 *   - Everything through cleanText(), which coerces rather than assumes — a
 *     JSON body can hand you a number where a string belongs, and `.trim()` on
 *     a number throws a TypeError that comes back as a 503 about the database.
 *   - It never reads anything back. There is no GET here at all. The list is
 *     other people's email addresses; it is readable on the dashboard, behind
 *     the password, and nowhere else.
 *
 * It also never says whether an address is already on the list. "You are
 * already signed up" turns this into a way to test whether a given trade has
 * registered, which is nobody's business but theirs — so a repeat submission
 * updates the row and answers exactly as a new one does.
