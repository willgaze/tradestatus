/**
 * The customer's half of agreeing a window.
 *
 * A window has always been a two-way arrangement pretending to be a broadcast.
 * The trade says "between 9 and 11", the customer is on a call until half
 * eleven, and the first either of them hears about it is a missed doorbell.
 * Two taps settle it.
 *
 * Either end can open the conversation: a customer with a day booked and no
 * hours agreed can ask for some, rather than waiting to be told.
 *
 * What they ask for is theirs. It goes to the trade and to this device, never
 * onto the page — "I'm free between 2 and 4" says when a house is occupied,
 * and the link gets forwarded. So while the customer's own offer is on the
 * table the page says it is waiting, and only this phone can say what for.
