/**
 * A real customer page, with an invented job in it.
 *
 * The strongest thing the homepage can do is show the thing working rather
 * than describe it, and a screenshot is not that — a screenshot cannot be
 * tapped, and the rows on this page are the point.
 *
 * It is the same component the customer gets, from the same fixture the diary
 * is captured from. The banner is the difference, and it is not optional: a
 * page showing Sarah Whitfield's address with no mark on it is a page somebody
 * will think is somebody's real job.
 *
 * `robots: index false` — it is linked, not found. Its content is a worked
 * example of what a tracking link looks like, and a tracking link is exactly
 * what must never be in a search index, even a pretend one.
