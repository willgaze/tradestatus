/**
 * "They have set off" on the lock screen.
 *
 * This is the nearest thing to the wallet card that exists without paying
 * anyone: iOS 16.4 and later deliver web push to a page the customer has added
 * to their home screen, with no Apple Developer membership and no App Store.
 * Android has done it for years. It costs nothing and it is the whole promise
 * of the product — the customer stops checking the page, because the page
 * tells them.
 *
 * THE HOME SCREEN CATCH. On iPhone this only works once the page is installed
 * to the home screen: Safari in a tab cannot subscribe at all, and the call
 * fails rather than prompting. The customer's page therefore asks them to add
 * it first, and says so plainly, because a dead button is worse than no button.
 *
 * WHAT A NOTIFICATION MAY SAY. It lands on a lock screen, which is the least
 * private surface this product touches — visible to whoever picks the phone up
 * off the kitchen table. So it carries the trade's name and the stage, and
 * nothing else. Never the address, never the job reference, never the
 * customer's name, and never a note (which is free text and could say
 * anything). Anyone who wants the detail opens the link, where the code is the
 * credential.
 *
 * And the rule that governs every other surface governs this one: it states
 * what has happened. "Has set off" is a fact. "Arriving in 20 minutes" is a
 * promise nobody can keep, and a push notification is the very worst place to
 * make one.
