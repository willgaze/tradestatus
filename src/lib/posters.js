/**
 * The frames: every sentence the homepage says, with the screen that proves it.
 *
 * Plain data in its own module because the homepage (a server component) and
 * /preview/posters (a client component) both read it, and a named export from
 * a 'use client' file arrives on the server as a reference, not an array.
 *
 * group    customer | trade | either | next
 * state    live   — a real capture of the real screen (public/home/*.webp)
 *          ready  — built, waiting on something outside the code (a certificate)
 *          next   — not built; drawn as a mock and badged so nobody is misled
 * screen   a capture; or `mock` names a drawing in Posters.jsx; or `wallet`.
 *
 * Four stage tints only, never invented: indigo for on-the-way things, blue
 * for booked/agreed, green for presence/done, orange for finding the door and
 * for pauses. Navy is the pass. Slate is the trade's own screens.
