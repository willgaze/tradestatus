// TurnUp — the five states a job can be in, in the customer's words.
//
// Wording rule: these describe what is happening now, never what will happen
// by a certain time. They also name nobody — this product is fitted by more
// than one trade, and the tradesperson's name comes from NEXT_PUBLIC_TRADE_NAME
// at the top of the page, never from copy baked into a shared constant. "On my way" is a fact. "With you in 20 minutes" is a
// promise one plumber cannot keep, and the site does not make it anywhere.
//
// `short` is the same stage in fewer characters, for the five-across control
// on the trade's own screen: at phone width the full labels wrapped to three
// lines each and the row stopped reading as one control. The customer is never
// shown `short` — they get the whole thing, because they have the room.
//
// `tone` does two jobs and is the only name a stage carries for either: it
// picks the colour (--stage-<tone> in globals.css) and the drawing (StageIcon
// in src/components/icons.jsx). It used to carry an emoji as well, which
// rendered in whatever style the customer's phone shipped and made a finished
// page look like a placeholder. This file is imported by the API routes, so it
// holds no JSX and no CSS — only the name.

// Relative, not '@/lib/window'. This file is loaded by plain node in
// scripts/check-public-shape.mjs, which has no bundler to resolve the '@'
// alias — and that check running without a build step is the point of it.

    //
    //   This payload carries what the TRADE told the CUSTOMER.

    //
    // The code in the URL is the only credential, and a tracking link gets
    // forwarded — to a partner, into a family group chat, onward from there.
    // Everything this function returns is readable by everyone that link
    // reaches, for as long as it is live.
    //
    // For a while it returned the customer's own answers too, and together
    // they stopped being a status page: the address, a photo of the house, a
    // photo of the front door, which door is used, "the gate sticks, park on
    // the verge", whether there is a dog, "No, I'm out", and "between 09:00
    // and 11:00". That is a door, a time and a way in, and it went to anyone
    // holding a forwarded link.
    //
    // So those fields are gone from here. The trade still sees every one of
    // them on the dashboard, which is behind a password. The customer's own
    // phone remembers what it sent, in src/app/t/own-answers.js, so their form
    // still prefills — on their device and nobody else's.
